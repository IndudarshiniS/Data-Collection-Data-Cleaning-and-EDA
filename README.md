# Data Collection, Data Cleaning and EDA 
In this project, I focused on analyzing data collected from the Cars24 website, a leading platform for buying and selling used cars. The dataset includes key features such as car price, rating, name, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and more. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover trends and insights.
