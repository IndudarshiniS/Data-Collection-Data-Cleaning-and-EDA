# Data Collection, Data Cleaning and EDA 
In this project, I focused on analyzing data collected from the Cars24 website, a leading platform for buying and selling used cars. The dataset includes key features such as car price, rating, name, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and more. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover trends and insights within the used car market, addressing critical business questions related to pricing strategies, customer preferences, and market demand. Throughout this presentation, I will guide you through the business problem, the objectives of the project, the web scraping process, and the exploratory data analysis conducted to extract valuable insights from the collected data.
